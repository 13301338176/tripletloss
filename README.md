# Triplet Loss Repository : 

Contains : 
- 02 tripletloss MNIST : building a similarity comparer using triplet loss function on MNIST. This project is covered by my article on Medium : https://medium.com/@crimy/one-shot-learning-siamese-networks-and-triplet-loss-with-keras-2885ed022352

A subsequent work on quadruplet loss:
- 27 tripletloss vs quadrupletloss MNIST : comparing a triplet loss system vs an improved system using learned metric and quadruplet loss on the MNIST dataset
- 28 tripletloss vs quadrupletloss OMNIGLOT : same on the OMNIGLOT dataset. This project is covered by my article on medium https://medium.com/@crimy/beyond-triplet-loss-one-shot-learning-experiments-with-quadruplet-loss-16671ed51290?sk=bf41673664ad8a52e322380f2a456e8b
