# Triplet Loss Repository : 

Contains : 
- 02 tripletloss MNIST : building a similarity comparer using triplet loss function on MNIST. This project is covered by my article on Medium : https://medium.com/@crimy/one-shot-learning-siamese-networks-and-triplet-loss-with-keras-2885ed022352

A subsequent work on quadruplet loss:
- 27 tripletloss vs quadrupletloss OMNIGLOT : comparing a triplet loss system vs an improved system using learned metric and quadruplet loss on the MNIST dataset
- 28 tripletloss vs quadrupletloss OMNIGLOT : same on the OMNIGLOT dataset. This project is covered by my article on medium (final link to be updated soon)
